### :bangbang: Attention: do not open PRs to THIS repository. Instead, once ready, open a PR to the repository [hackathon2022proceedings](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2022proceedings) :bangbang:

Here you can find the LaTeX and office templates for the Brainhack OHBM 2022 proceedings! Once ready, the full collection of proceedings will be submitted as an article to Aperture, making it public and citable.
Submission is not mandatory, and it does not necessarily require deliverables nor major accomplishments during the Brainhack. A short description of your intentions, short-term and long-term goals and, if any, achievements is more than enough!

Each summary must have a title, a list of authors and affiliations, and a text of up to 500 words. It can also have up to one figure (with caption of up to 250 characters) and up to ten references. Title, authors, affiliations, figure caption, and references are not considered in the 500 words count.

You can submit the summary written in LaTeX using the template in the `summaries` folder by Friday, July 15th 2022 (let us know if you need an extension already).
In order to do so, please send an email to s.moia.research@gmail.com, or open a PR to the repository [hackathon2022proceedings](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2022proceedings).

`.odt` and `.doc` template files are also available and accepted, but since they will be transformed into LaTeX, we're not guaranteeing text formatting. Please read carefully the template document where you will find more instructions. In case you are submitting a figure, do not just embed it text, but rather send it with the text itself, and if you can, provide a `.bib` (biblatex references) file with your references inside. If you use an `.odt` or `.doc` file, please send it over via email to s.moia.research@gmail.com
